/data:dataset & dataloader & data pre-processing

/nets & scls:implementation for our network (WS-DMF)

/utils:implementation for loss function & optimizer

/onnx
-   Pytorch trained weights from DRIVE, STARE datasets.
-   The *.onnx weights can be directly used to extract vessels from fundus images, see onnx\infer.py

/results
-   segmentation results for popular datasets
-   segmentation results for cross-dataset-validation
